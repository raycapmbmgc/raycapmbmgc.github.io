    I'm findin' ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through <br>
I just can't say I don't love you <br>
'Cause I love you, yeah <br>
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold <br>
But tonight I'm gon' let you know <br>
Let me tell the truth <br>
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah<br>
<br>
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br>
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night<br>
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time<br>
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love<br>
I try to find a reason to pull us apart<br>
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
And I know that you're worth it<br>
I can't walk away, oh!<br>
<br>
Even though we're going through it<br>
And it makes you feel alone<br>
Just know that I would die for you<br>
Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
The distance and the time between us<br>  
<br>  
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby<br>  
I would die for you<br>  
Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>  

I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through<br>  
But baby girl, I'm not blamin' you<br>  
Just don't blame me, too, yeah<br>  
'Cause I can't take this pain forever<br>  
And you won't find no one that's better<br>  
'Cause I'm right for you, babe<br>  
I think I'm right for you, babe<br>  
<br>  
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br>  
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>  
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>  
And I know that you're worth it<br>  
I can't walk away, oh!<br>  
<br>  
Even though we're going through it<br>  
And it makes you feel alone<br>  
Just know that I would die for you<br>  
Baby, I would die for you, yeahr<br>
